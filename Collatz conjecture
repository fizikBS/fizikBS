## Objectives

# Write a code that for given natural number "n" calculates sequence of number until reaches the 1 (one), by rules;
# İf number is odd 3*n+1 is applied
# İf number is even n/2 is applied
# Repeat Until the number reaches 1
# Print the sequence as a list and its maximum value and number of steps to get 4-2-1 sequence

#
# The code below is ansver in Python
#

def collatz(n):
    sequence = []  # Sequence List
    max_value = n  # Variable for maximum value in the sequence
    while n > 1:
        sequence.append(n)
        if n > max_value:
            max_value = n  # Update the maximum value
        if (n % 2):
            # n is odd
            n = 3 * n + 1
        else:
            # n is even
            n = n // 2
    sequence.append(1)
    return sequence, max_value  # Return the sequence and the maximum value

n = int(input('Enter n: '))
sequence, max_in_sequence = collatz(n)
print('Sequence:', sequence)
print(f'Maximum value in the sequence: {max_in_sequence}')
print(f'Number of steps to end is: {len(sequence) - 1}')

#
# The code Ends
#

# You may try for 5, 7 ,16, 27 and 28 gives interesting results
# Expected Outcome for 28;
#
Enter n: 28
Sequence: [28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]
Maximum value in the sequence: 52
Number of steps to end is: 18

Good Luck!
